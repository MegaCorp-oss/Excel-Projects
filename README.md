# Excel-Projects

Welcome to my Excel Projects Portfolio, where I practice using Excel to explore, organize, and analyze data. These projects focus on creating spreadsheets, using formulas, pivot tables, and basic visualizations to answer real-world business and operational questions.

I’m actively building my Excel and data analysis skills, and this portfolio will continue to grow with new projects and challenges. It’s a place to showcase my problem-solving approach and readiness for entry-level data analytics roles.
